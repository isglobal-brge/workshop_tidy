# Welcome to the Tidyverse & Machine Learning Workshop

## Course Overview

This comprehensive workshop provides a complete journey through data science in R, from basic data manipulation with the tidyverse to advanced machine learning with tidymodels. Whether you're new to R or looking to expand your skills, this course offers practical, hands-on learning with real-world datasets.

## What You'll Learn

### Part 1: Tidyverse Fundamentals (Chapters 1-7)
Master the core packages of the tidyverse ecosystem:

- **Data Import & Export**: Read and write various file formats efficiently
- **Data Wrangling**: Transform and manipulate data with dplyr
- **Data Tidying**: Reshape and organize messy data with tidyr
- **Data Visualization**: Create publication-ready plots with ggplot2
- **Functional Programming**: Apply functions efficiently with purrr
- **Text & Date Processing**: Handle strings and temporal data

### Part 2: Tidymodels Framework (Chapters 8-13)
Build a solid foundation in modern machine learning workflows:

- **Tidymodels Ecosystem**: Understand the framework and its components
- **Data Preparation**: Split data and create resampling schemes
- **Feature Engineering**: Preprocess data with recipes
- **Model Building**: Specify and train models with parsnip
- **Workflows**: Create reproducible modeling pipelines
- **Model Tuning**: Optimize hyperparameters systematically

### Part 3: Machine Learning Applications (Chapters 14-18)
Apply your skills to real-world problems:

- **Classification**: Build and evaluate classification models
- **Regression**: Develop predictive regression models
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine models for better performance
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Discover patterns with clustering and PCA
- **Model Deployment**: Put models into production
